    <h1>Hi, I'm Matt.</h1>
    <div id="intro">
        <h2>A bit about who, and why I am.</h2>
        <p></p><p>Figuring out my first stop-motion animation (at around the age of 8), witnessed by scrolling through the preview screen of a digital camera was a formative moment. I briefly had the thought that I had invented animation. This turned out not to be the case, but despite this, an important realisation was made. Making things with technology is my idea of a good time. Since then, I have accumlated a wide range of skills and experiences in a variety of creative software.</p> 
            
            <br>Some highlights include:<ul><br><li>Providing teaching support in video-production summer programme at the Digital Media Academy a programme aimed providing students technical and creative skills using industry-standard software and hardware.</li> 
            
            <li>My accumulated video and illustration content posted on instagram and YouTube (short films, animations, illustrations etc.).</li>
            
            <li>Modelling and rigging a playable character using 3DS Max, Maya, Z Brush, in Unreal Engine.</li></ul> 
            
            <p>Fast forward to today, and I am enrolled in edX's Front-end Web-development course on track to receive my W3Cx's Front-End Web Developer Professional Certificate, and am hoping to take the skills I have learned to the next level in a challenging new professional environment!</p>
            
            <br><ul><li>On this site are some samples of things that I am proud of, and would love if you would have a look!</li>
